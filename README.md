# Fly Notes
An exercise in creating a react notes SPA; also using tachyons for styles

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To run locally, run `npm install`, then once finished, run `npm start`.

Currently this only runs for the active browser window - refresh or close the tab, start over!

## Things to make this better

- defaultProps & [propTypes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types)
- you know, a back end & actual storage ([firebase?](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#firebase))
